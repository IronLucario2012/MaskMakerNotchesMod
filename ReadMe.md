# MaskMakerNotches

A mod that adds a few buyable Charm Notches near Mask Maker. Intended for use with mods that add charms to better allow us to use the new things they add, and also Randomizer.

Note: This mod adds the notches on save creation; if you add this mod to an existing game file the notches will not appear. This is a known issue and when I have time to figure out how to fix that and implement it I will get around to it eventually.
